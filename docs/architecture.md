# SmartTasks Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The SmartTasks application is designed as a task and project management tool that follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and adheres to the SOLID principles. The architecture is structured to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Clean Architecture

The application is built using Clean Architecture, which separates the application into layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for the user interface and user interaction. In the SmartTasks application, this is handled by the Flutter frontend.
  
- **Domain Layer**: This layer contains the business logic and domain entities. It is independent of any frameworks or external libraries, ensuring that the core functionality can be tested and maintained separately.

- **Data Layer**: This layer is responsible for data management, including API calls and database interactions. The Django backend serves as the data layer, providing a RESTful API for the frontend.

### 2. RESTful API

The backend is designed as a RESTful API, allowing the frontend to communicate with it using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This approach ensures that the application can be easily integrated with other services and platforms.

### 3. Authentication

SmartTasks implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. This allows for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.

### 4. Modular Design

The application is divided into modules (users, projects, tasks) in the backend, each with its own models, views, serializers, and services. This modular design promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.

### 5. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided for both the API and the authentication process. This includes details on endpoints, request/response formats, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Conclusion

The SmartTasks architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and maintainable, following best practices in software development. By adhering to OOP and SOLID principles, the application is positioned for future growth and enhancements.
