# Authentication Documentation for SmartTasks

## Overview
The SmartTasks application utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This allows for secure communication between the client and server, ensuring that user credentials are not exposed.

## Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration**: 
   - Users can create an account by providing necessary details such as email, password, and full name.
   - Upon successful registration, a confirmation email may be sent to the user.

2. **User Login**: 
   - Users can log in using their email and password.
   - On successful login, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.

3. **Token Storage**: 
   - The client stores the JWT securely (e.g., in local storage or secure storage).

4. **Authenticated Requests**: 
   - For any requests that require authentication, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header as follows:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```

5. **Token Expiration**: 
   - JWTs have an expiration time. The client should handle token expiration by prompting the user to log in again or by implementing a refresh token mechanism.

## JWT Structure
A JWT consists of three parts:
- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token and the signing algorithm.
- **Payload**: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
- **Signature**: Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

## Security Considerations
- Always use HTTPS to protect the token during transmission.
- Implement proper validation and expiration checks on the server side.
- Consider using refresh tokens to enhance security and user experience.

## Conclusion
The authentication mechanism in SmartTasks is designed to be secure and user-friendly, leveraging JWT for efficient and safe user sessions. For further details on API endpoints related to authentication, refer to the API documentation.
